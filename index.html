            Its the next big breakthrough in technology. Its a joke. Its a
            marketing strategy. Its a techno-dystopian nightmare. Its the
            <strong>metaverse</strong> — defined most simply as a virtual world
            where people can socialize, work, and play — and Facebooks CEO Mark
            Zuckerberg believes it is the future of the internet and of his
            trillion-dollar company.Although “metaverse” became a buzzword after
            Facebook changed its company name to
            <strong><em>“Meta”</em></strong> last month, many people are still
            trying to understand what exactly the metaverse is and whether the
            futuristic technological concept is something they should take
            seriously. Many critics and skeptics have mocked Zuckerbergs plan to
            change Facebook from a social media company to a metaverse company.
            Some critics say that by focusing on the metaverse and renaming
            itself while the company is reeling from a PR crisis, Facebook is
            distracting from the problems it creates or contributes to in the
            real world: issues like harming teens mental health, facilitating
            the spread of disinformation, and fueling political polarization.
